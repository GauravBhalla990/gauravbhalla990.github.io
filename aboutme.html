        Since my time in high school, I have been greatly interested in physics, astronomy, mathematics, computers and electronics. During the summer of 2020, I was given an opportunity to practice some of my back-end web development skills and gain experience working in industry through an internship at PCCI. I also learned some front-end web development skills which I used to develop this website. Then, during the august 2020 - march 2021 as an ASIC Validation researcher, I was given the oppurtunity to validate the PCB used for testing the ASIC, and also generate the clock and reset waveforms used to drive the ASIC. Currently, I am working on developing a routing algorithm to efficiently connect the resources that are placed on the FGPA when it is going to emulate an ASIC or other computer chip. I enrolled in the corps of cadets program during my first year of college to develop my leadership, teamwork and time-management skills. After, I worked as a peer mentor and a Resident advisor to continue developing my intrapersonal skills.

       After experiencing my intro. to analog design class, I was captivated by analog design, and decided to devote more time to analog design. Since studying for my technician license, I have also been interested how EM waves travel and interact with the atmosphere.
       Subsequently, I took the advanced analog design class in Fall 2021, started preparing for my amateur general and extra licenses, and have recently started working to develop a more advanced AM crystal radio. I have also started reading an introduction to Electricity & Magnetism textbook by David J. Griffith to get a better understanding of the physics.

        Through my Digital Design class, I have practiced basic circuit design with ICs on breadboards, and then learned how to use the Verilog HDL. Furthermore, through my Computer Architecture class, I designed a model for a single cycle ARMv8 processor with Verilog. Using the experience from these classes, I am working on building a computer from the ground up with Nand2Tetris.
