        Since my time in high school, I have been greatly interested in physics, mathematics, computers and electronics. During the summer of 2020, I was given an opportunity to practice some of my back-end web development skills and gain experience working in industry through an internship at PCCI.

        As an ASIC validation researcher during 2020-2021 at Texas A&M, I worked on validating an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) with guidance from my mentor every week. The ASIC is designed to detect alpha particles and I have read through the specification document to learn the requirements to validate the ASIC. To validate the ASIC, I will use a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to interface the ASIC with my computer. Last fall, I validated the connections on the PCB with a multimeter. This semester, I hope to validate the ASIC in the lab.

        In RoboMaster Robotics, I programmed a function to deliver power to the motors turning the wheels on our Standard robot in a three-member team within the given timeline of two weeks and pushed the new code to our GitHub repository. Over the winter break, on my own initiative, I then helped my supervisor debug the function as he executed the updated code on the Standard robot. In the summer of 2021, I volunteered as a boarder referee for the Robomaster's robotics competition.

        Through my Digital Design class, I have practiced basic circuit design with ICs on breadboards, and then learned how to use the Verilog HDL. Furthermore, through my Computer Architecture class, I designed a model for a single cycle ARMv8 processor with Verilog. Using the experience from these classes, I hope to build a computer from the ground up. I am also preparing for the general and amateur extra licensure exams. Moreover, I am working on iterations of a basic AM crystal radio and have started with a foxhole radio.

         Starting in June 2022, I am hoping to work as an electronic instrument technician, a software engineer, an entry level HIL (controls) engineer or a design engineer.
