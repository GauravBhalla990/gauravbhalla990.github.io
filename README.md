# Personal_Website
LINK - http://people.tamu.edu/~gauravbhalla/
This repository just holds the code for the static web pages used for my personal website. Right now, I am serving these web pages with the Apache webserver already installed on the people.tamu.edu server. In the near future, I will configure a Node.js "server" on a basic VM from the GCP platform to serve the content from a React.js app.
