          <h3> ASIC Validation </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>As an ASIC validation researcher at Texas A&M, I worked on validating an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) with guidance from my mentor every week.  </li>
            <li>The ASIC is designed to detect alpha particles and I have read through the specification document to learn the requirements to validate the ASIC.</li>
            <li> To validate the ASIC, I would use a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to interface the ASIC with my computer.</li>
            <li> During my time on this project, I validated the connections on the PCB with a multimeter, and generated the clock and reset waveforms that would be used to drive the ASIC chip with an Arduino Mega.</li>
            <li> Solved logic-level voltage compatibility issue with a Texas Instruments 74LVC245 Logic Level Voltage Shifter integrated circuit. </li>

            <li>Over the winter break, on my own initiative, I then helped my supervisor debug the function as he executed the updated code on the Standard robot.</li>
            <li>In the summer of 2021, I volunteered as a boarder referee for the Robomaster's robotics competition.</li>

            <li>Company users were authenticated when signing in to the web application with the Microsoft Azure Active Directory service and automatically added to a table in a PostgreSQL database after their first time logging in.</li>
            <li>The website pages were updated by the Guinocorn application server before being sent to the client's browser via the Ngninx reverse proxy server.</li>
            <li>The Gunicorn WSGI and Ngnix reverse proxy servers were configured on an Azure Linux VM.</li>
